## ðŸš€ Projects

### **Project 1: Building SVM and k-NN Classifiers from Scratch**
**Abstract:**  
Build advanced models from scratch, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).  
For SVM, implement the kernel trick (linear, polynomial, and RBF) manually to map input data into higher-dimensional spaces and maximize the margin between classes.  
For k-NN, manually implement distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.) and the k-selection process using the Elbow Method, determining the optimal number of neighbors for classification.  
Avoid using high-level libraries like Scikit-learn for these tasks, and ensure both models are optimized and fully functional.

**Keywords:** SVM from scratch, kernel trick, polynomial kernel, RBF kernel, k-NN implementation, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Elbow Method, manual machine learning, optimization, Python  

**Technology:** Data Science & Machine Learning

### **Project 2: Time-Based Stock Price Prediction for TSLA**
**Abstract:**  
Partition the dataset into training and testing subsets using an 80/20 time-based split.  
Develop a Linear Regression model for TSLA price prediction, incorporating lag features and technical indicators.  
Evaluate the model's performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².  
Follow up with Decision Tree and Random Forest models, optimizing hyperparameters and visualizing feature importance.

**Keywords:** TSLA stock prediction, time series split, lag features, technical indicators, linear regression, decision tree, random forest, model evaluation, feature importance, hyperparameter tuning, financial forecasting, stock price modeling  

**Technology:** Data Science & Machine Learning
